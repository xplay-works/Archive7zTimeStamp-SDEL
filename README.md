# Archive7zTimeStamp-SDEL
Add a context menu entry for folders to Windows explorer. 

This lets you create a timestamped archive of a folder with two clicks.

Plus -sdel (Delete folder after compression) switch syntax.


# IDEA
If you mess around with some folders it's nice to have a backup/archive of it. 

7Zip has a nice context menu to do it quite quickly. 

If you do it more often it is nice to have a timestamped archive and delete folder automatically.
